# Lang

Hi

Thanks for visiting my lang respository.

In this repository, I learn how to use lang to

1. import openai, prompt template, build chain, simple sequential chain, sequential chain, agents, and use memory for conversation chain
2. use huggingfaceapi
3. create restaurant name generator for cuisines with menu items using streamlit
4. (langflow) RAG with LLM

The tutorials are from codebasics, and freecodecamp.
