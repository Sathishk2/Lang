# Langchain

Hi

Thanks for visiting my langchain respository.

In this repository, I learn how to use langchain to

1. import openai. build chain, simple sequential chain, sequential chain, agents. use memory for conversation chain
2. use huggingfaceapi
3. create restaurant name generator for cuisines with menu items using streamlit

The tutorials are from codebasics, and freecodecamp.
